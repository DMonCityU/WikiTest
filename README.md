# ChatGPT-Driven Wiki Project

---

This is an ongoing, interest-driven project meant to define and, more importantly, tie together relevant concepts in cybersecurity.
Over time, the goal is to robustly and consistently link vocabulary with its underlying history and context.
At terminators to specialized knowledge, for example technical details of a specific algorithm, further reading will be provided.
    - The scope of this project is general knowledge.
    - The further reading serves as both a referral to source and as the foundation of an ethos network.

  1. On page creation, submit the page title to ChatGPT for comment. It will usually offer a simple definition or ask for disambiguation. Tweak the prompt as necessary to elicit the definition.
  1. If the supplied definition does not address the context which motivated the prompt, ask followup questions in a way that encourages ChatGPT to affirm or deny.
  1. Link relevant vocabulary as in Link Pages. Mentions in followup questions should be those linked.
